storyboard ideas:

Scene 1: (in black and white) we are introduced to a messy room with a man lying in bed, the blinds are drawn but it is clear from the amount of light leaking in that it is midday


Jump cut to phone screen displaying notification to take pills
*BEEP* *BEEP*
He dismisses it and takes his pills which are sitting in a small pill cup next to his bed. (some color is added back into the video) He turns back over to face away from the windows and pulls the covers up a little

Jump cut to the phone going off again, this time notifying that he has been in bed for over 9 hours, the man gets out of bed as more color is returned to the video

fade out

Scene 2: we see our guy walking down the street, goes to light up a cigarette and takes one drag, the phone goes off again and tells him that hes quitting. he puts the cigarette out and more color is returned to the screen

he bumps into a friend and they go to a coffee shop, theyre just chilling when his phone goes off with a notification asking him how hes feeling, to which he responds positively
